            Wolverine is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, mostly in association with the X-Men. He is a mutant who possesses animal-keen senses, enhanced physical capabilities, a powerful regenerative ability known as a healing factor, and three retractable claws in each hand. Wolverine has been depicted variously as a member of the X-Men, Alpha Flight, and the Avengers.

            Wolverine is typical of the many tough antiheroes that emerged in American popular culture after the Vietnam War,his willingness to use deadly force and his brooding nature became standard characteristics for comic book antiheroes by the end of the 1980s.As a result, the character became a fan favorite of the increasingly popular X-Men franchise,and has been featured in his own solo comic book series since 1988.He has appeared in most X-Men adaptations, including animated television series, video games, and the live-action 20th Century Fox X-Men film series, in which he is played by Hugh Jackman.

        As one of the most popular characters in all of comics, Wolverine has experienced quite a lot since first making his explosive debut. For years, the mutant has played many roles throughout the Marvel universe and remains one of the more influential characters within it.So why is Wolverine the most famous mutant? Healing power: Wolverine can heal from anything. He has survived nuclear holocaust, chopping of limbs, adamantium bullet to the brain to name a few. The only sureshot way of killing him is to separate his skeleton from adamantium (which Magneto did to kill him once).
